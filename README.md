# DEEPFAKE_DETECTION_SYSTEM
Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Deepfake Detection System that operates across three distinct platforms: online images, online videos, and live webcam feeds. Utilizing MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for efficient face detection and a dummy classifier to simulate deepfake detection, the system offers real-time media content analysis, identifying synthetic manipulations across different formats.

The system is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring no deep technical expertise. It enables users to detect deepfakes in images, videos, and live webcam streams, supporting applications in social media moderation, digital forensics, and cybersecurity.
